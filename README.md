## mb-diag-autogen:  automatic generation of code for many body diagrams

Copyright Andre Severo Pereira Gomes and contributors 2020-2022.

# Aims and scope

This project provides processing tools to go from many-body diagrams defined by the domain-specific language SIAL (e.g. as generated
by DiaGen code by Dmitry Liakh) to programmable expressions and code, for (non-)relativistic correlated methods.
